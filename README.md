# Space
Hello, I made a side project of an educational website about Space using Html, Css and Java Script. this website is designed to introduce basic astronomy concepts to students in a fun and interactive way."
This website is still not perfect therefore I will improve in the future. I will plan:
1) Publish the website on Google so that this website will be seen by millions of people.
2) remake it into a more interactive and detailed website
3.) add a quiz feature

That's all from me and thank you!
