                <h1 class="text1">What Is Space?</h1>
                <h4 class="text2" style="font-weight: normal;">Space is a vast region beyond Earth's atmosphere,
                    a place where there is no air, almost no matter, and the physical conditions are very different from those on Earth.
                    Space begins about 100 kilometers above sea level, at a boundary called the Kármán Line.<br>
                    Beyond this line lies the expanse of the universe, which includes countless celestial bodies such as stars, planets, moons, asteroids, and galaxies. 
                    Space is not completely empty — it contains traces of gas, dust, and energetic particles, as well as invisible phenomena like dark matter and dark energy.
                    The universe itself is believed to have originated from the Big Bang, a massive explosion that occurred approximately 13.8 billion years ago.
                    Since then, space has been expanding, and astronomers continue to observe its evolution using advanced telescopes and space missions.

                <h4 class="text-4" style="font-weight: normal;">Human exploration of space began in the 20th century,
                    with milestones such as the launch of Sputnik in 1957, the first manned Moon landing in 1969, 
                    and the ongoing research aboard the International Space Station (ISS). These missions have deepened our understanding of space environments, physics, 
                    and the potential for life beyond Earth.
                In recent decades, space exploration has entered a new phase marked by international cooperation and commercial innovation. Space agencies such as NASA (United States), ESA (Europe),
                Roscosmos (Russia), CNSA (China), and JAXA (Japan) continue to lead scientific missions, while private companies like SpaceX, Blue Origin, and Rocket Lab are revolutionizing how we access and utilize space.
                One major focus of current exploration is the Moon, with programs like NASA’s Artemis aiming to return humans to the lunar surface and establish a sustainable presence.
                Mars has also become a key target, with robotic missions such as NASA’s Perseverance rover searching for signs of past life and preparing for future crewed missions.</h4>

                Uranus is known for its extreme tilt, as if the planet is ‘rolling’ as it orbits the Sun.Uranus rotates on its axis at an inclination of about 97.77 degrees, making it appear to roll in its orbit.
                Due to its unique rotation, Uranus experiences very long seasons, with one season lasting about 42 Earth years. Uranus is the coldest planet in the solar system, with the lowest temperature reaching -224°C.
                Uranus has a ring system, although it is not as clear and bright as Saturn's rings. Uranus is also the only planet to be named after a character in Greek mythology, from a Latinised version of the name of the Greek sky god Ouranos.</h4>

Jupiter is known as a ‘gas giant’ because it is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium. In addition, Jupiter has large red spots that are giant storms that have lasted for centuries.
                Jupiter has a diameter of about 140,000 kilometres, making it 11 times larger than Earth.Jupiter has a mass about 2.5 times the mass of all the other planets in the solar system combined.

                Mars has two moons named Phobos and Deimos. Mars' environment is more hospitable to life than that of Venus. However, it is not ideal for humans. 
                The low temperature and low air pressure, coupled with the mostly carbon dioxide composition of the air, means that humans would have to use breathing apparatus if they wanted to live there.</h4>

                Venus is known to be the hottest planet in our solar system, even though it is not the closest to the Sun. 
                This is because Venus' thick, carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere creates a very strong greenhouse effect. Venus is similar in size and mass to Earth, 
                often referred to as Earth's ‘twin sister’. Venus' surface temperature can reach 471 degrees Celsius, making it the hottest planet in the solar system.

                Its revolutionary period is the shortest of all the planets in the Solar System at 87.79 days. 
                Like Venus, Mercury is an inferior planet whose orbit lies inside the Earth's orbit, and when observed from Earth, 
                its angular distance from the Sun never exceeds 28°. Due to its close proximity to the Sun, the planet can only be seen near the western horizon after sunset or 
                the eastern horizon before sunrise, or usually at dawn. Mercury will appear like a bright star if observed at these times, 
                but it is often much harder to observe than Venus. If observed from a telescope, Mercury will display a series of phases similar to those of Venus and the Moon, 
                as it moves in its inner orbit relative to Earth and repeats itself in one synodic cycle, which is about 116 days.</h4>

                <h3>Technical Specs</h3>
                <p>Hubble has a 2.4-meter mirror and instruments that observe in the ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared spectra. Despite initial problems with its mirror, servicing missions have kept it operational for decades.</p>
